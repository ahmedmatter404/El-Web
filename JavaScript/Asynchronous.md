# Explanation

## Asynchronous vs Synchronous

- _Asynchronous Code_:
    - Code Doesn't Block code after it from execution
    - runs in background
    - e.g setTimeOut
- _Synchronous Code_: Each line waits for the previous line to finish

## Behind The Scenes

- [[How the Web Works?]]

## Update Timeline

- We used to communicate with web servers [[AJAX]]
- Now we use [[Promises]] to
    - [[Avoid callback hell]]
    - we have Promise chain instead
- to Avoid Promise Chain, JS Built [[async-await]] as syntax Sugar above then method
