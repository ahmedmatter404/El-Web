# Explanation

## Prototype

- An Object all functions have
- Linked to Objects Instantiated from Constructor functions
- Has Its own Properties
    - shared to instances
    - sounds like static for class in c++

## Prototypal Inhertience

- Objects Linked to Prototype
    - can access its methods
    - Delegate to it if calling Prototype Properties

## Prototype Chain

- Object is Linked to Prototype by _proto_ and prototyped is linked to its parent
- and so on till we reach **Object**
    - is parent of all
    - Its _proto_ is null to break the chain
    - Has Built-in Methods we reach by _Prototype Inheritance_
