- Why Can't with JS :dev_javascript_original:?
    - Requires a lot of DOM Manipulation `Spaghetti code`
    - State is Stored in the DOM, Shared Across the app
        - [[Race Condition]]: Multiple functions may change the same data
        - Hard to keep syncing state in all places
- Why Use Frameworks?
    - Keeping UI and state in Sync away from us
    - Well consistent Structure codebase
